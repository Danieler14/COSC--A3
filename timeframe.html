<h3>Weeks 9-14</h3>
<p>In the first 6 weeks, I plan to research the possible tools that I could use to create the app and to have all the screens ready with designs and buttons working. Furthermore, I hope to add transitions to screens to make it look realistic. I also plan to write up the report in Week 12 as I know that writing can take a while especially if I were to rewrite my work a lot of times so that it sounds better and is coherent.</p>
<h3>Weeks 14 +</h3>
<p>In the next 10 weeks of this project, I hope to make the app fully functional and have the app be downloadable on the app store. Within week 15 and week 16, I aim to research the creation of a login system that requires an email and a password, begin development of it and implement it into the app. In week 17 and 18, I would add more features to the settings tab which could include a My Profile/My Account screen, a help screen, an about screen and more.Within these two weeks, I would also begin to implement the usage of the phone’s location when in the app so that the user can utilise the maps tab. In week 19 and 20, I would not only begin linking the camera app of the phone and the PTV Rewards app together so that the user can use the QR code tab, but also create and develop a system that connects the user’s account to their Myki through the 15-digit number at the back of the card. Within weeks 21 and 22, I would link the PTV Myki system to the app so that it tracks when a person has touched on and touched off. This would enable the recent transactions feature on the credits screen to work. I would also have a link within the settings bar to link the app to the website. In the final two weeks, I would send the app to the testers, review the feedback that is given and make the final changes so that the app is ready to be downloaded and used.</p>

<h3>Weeks 9-14</h3>
<p>For the first weeks of development, I plan to create mockups for the app and the website to ensure that all aspects needed by this Rewards application are covered. There should be no aspects of the app that are not able to be implemented by the website. After the mock ups are done we will then divide our group into 2, with 3 people working on the app portion and the group website repository and 4 people working on the website prototype. The website prototype should be able to exemplify the basic function of the website and allow the viewer to click through and navigate through each page seamlessly. I will have to figure out how to import the prototype and upload it for the purpose of this assignment. The website should be fully finished before the due date and allow for the website group to be able to test and view the website to check for anything missed.
</p>
<h3>Weeks 14 +</h3>
<p>In the upcoming weeks, it will be important to procure employees responsible for the security checks needed to allow business users to sign up to the website. The website should be able to be fully linked to the application after this point and testing will need to be done to confirm that any updates to the website are reflected by the app. For the purpose of testing we shall create various different test businesses in order to see how this functions from website to app. It will be important to ensure that any updates made to the website update the app in real time. It will also be important to be able to develop a link between the store locations and the maps aspect of the website and app to ensure that all coupons available are visible to the users of the PTV Rewards App. The graph portion of the insights page should also update with real time data. It will most likely be required that we will need to hire database experts in order for this to occur. Consultation with various other IT companies is pertinent to manage the deployment of this system.

<h3>Weeks 9-14</h3>
<p>At first, it is important for me to have a clear overview on what the project is all about. Therefore I would spend most of my time researching the majority of the contents. Having information beforehand helps me alot in moving forward on contributing as a member of the team. Splitting into two groups in between the project as to one mainly works on the website and application for the other, is a good idea of letting each member work on more at 1 side of the project and vice versa.</p>
<h3>Weeks 14 +</h3>
<p>I fully hope the development of our project becomes successful. Before putting it out into the public, it is essential to make sure the website and application of the project fully works. Next, having a beta version and testing it out within the group allows us to detect any errors or unsatisfactory problems which then can be improvised. After passing this phase, hiring engineers and professionals are complementary and a step forward in developing the project. </p>

<h3>Weeks 9-14</h3>
<p>To start the project, we first needed to decide on a project idea. While doing this, we looked at the benefits of each idea, and decided that the PTV Rewards System would be the best choice. Afterwards, we split up the group to complete the different aspects of the project. Although it’s important to understand what you were assigned, it’s also important to understand what the other people are assigned to do. Working on the website, this was completed to the best of our abilities, and the aspects of the report I was assigned was completed.
</p>
<h3>Weeks 14 +</h3>
<p>Looking into the future of the project, an understanding of how to connect a mobile application and a website is necessary. Once this has been understood, I can change my focus onto developing the website and mobile application while testing for bugs. If any bugs do occur, I would try and find a way to resolve the issue as fast as possible. After a few weeks of bug testing, I would look into hiring some people to work on the project with us.</p>

<h3>Weeks 9-14</h3>
<p>For the first weeks of the project, I would be planning on what our main aim and overview is for our project. With our aim being to give back to the community by rewarding those that do the right thing when using public transport, which is to touch on and off, I would then be looking for smaller goals that can help achieve this main objective of our project. From then on, I would start documenting the overview, the main aim and then the story of our “PTV reward system” , which is our progression with the app and website that the other people in my group is creating.</p>
<h3>Weeks 14 +</h3>
<p>After week 14, I would start having a detailed look at both the website and the app, and polishing the whole project ensuring that there are no errors. Once the website and app is published to the community, I would then start creating surveys for users to give their feedback on. With this information, I would be able to have a clear understanding of what our customers’ needs are and ensure that I would meet their needs. Moreover, I would then start looking for more businesses that can offer us higher discounts and if possible, finding larger businesses such as Mcdonalds, KFC, Guzman y Gomez etc that can help us. Lastly, with most of the main components being completed, I would then start searching for employees that can be part of our IT support and contact team assuming that there will be a large customer base that will be utilising our services. </p>

<h3>Weeks 9-14</h3>
<p>For the initial first few weeks of the project development, my goal was to conduct research on different ways to test both the website and mobile app. This involved creating a basic synopsis on what types of tests would be performed and finding our target audience alongside ways to measure success. We then split into 2 different groups to keep the website and app development separate whilst also breaking down the project in more bite-sized chunks. I was assigned to give everyone professional roles according to what they specialised in the project. Both the initial testing scheme and professional roles were completed during this time.</p>
<h3>Weeks 14 +</h3>
<p>Looking at the long term aspects of this project, an expansion for an in-depth testing procedure would definitely be essential to ensure the project runs adequately. Developing this testing procedure would be essential in the weeks after alongside finding a dedicated team to run tests. Furthermore, outsourcing jobs to complete the database portion of both the website and app would be necessary in order to make it fully functional for its release. Additional roles such as a market team would also be necessary for the promotion of the app. It would be most ideal to hire this team near the end of the project once all the nuisances are fixed and the app and website are ready to be released to the public.</p>

<h3>Weeks 9-14</h3>
<p>
In the initial weeks of the project I focused on developing an analysis of potential risks. This analysis was mainly focused on the risks that we could incur when making our deliverable, however, I also decided to include some risks that we could encounter if we decided to continue with our project. For said analysis I developed a table that touches on the musts of risk management: a brief description of the risk, likelihood of occurring, impact if the risk occurs, severity, mitigating action, and contingent action. For the risks of the assignments I also included a detailed description. As the features of the app prototype were almost ready, I started working on some potential design changes. After receiving feedback from the app group and when the features were done, I applied the changes to all of the prototype.
</p>
<h3>Weeks 14 +</h3>
<p>
Like I mentioned above, most of the risks I listed were focused on the assignment. Nevertheless, if we carry on developing the project new risks will come up. Therefore, the initial weeks I will focus on doing an extensive research of additional risks. I will analyse them  with the help of the table I mentioned above. This will be helpful for determining their severity of each one of them and discussing what would be their respective mitigating and contingent actions. Once the management risk plan is ready I'll make sure to share and explain it to the rest of the team. Due to the advancement in the functionalities of the app, i'll start working on the design modifications and ask for feedback. Once I make sure the app design is congruent to the webpage design I will apply new design to all of the app.
