<h3>Weeks 9-14</h3>
<p>In the first 6 weeks, I plan to research the possible tools that I could use to create the app and to have all the screens ready with designs and buttons working. Furthermore, I hope to add transitions to screens to make it look realistic. I also plan to write up the report in Week 12 as I know that writing can take a while especially if I were to rewrite my work a lot of times so that it sounds better and is coherent.</p>
<h3>Weeks 14 +</h3>
<p>In the next 10 weeks of this project, I hope to make the app fully functional and have the app be downloadable on the app store. Within week 15 and week 16, I aim to research the creation of a login system that requires an email and a password, begin development of it and implement it into the app. In week 17 and 18, I would add more features to the settings tab which could include a My Profile/My Account screen, a help screen, an about screen and more.Within these two weeks, I would also begin to implement the usage of the phone’s location when in the app so that the user can utilise the maps tab. In week 19 and 20, I would not only begin linking the camera app of the phone and the PTV Rewards app together so that the user can use the QR code tab, but also create and develop a system that connects the user’s account to their Myki through the 15-digit number at the back of the card. Within weeks 21 and 22, I would link the PTV Myki system to the app so that it tracks when a person has touched on and touched off. This would enable the recent transactions feature on the credits screen to work. I would also have a link within the settings bar to link the app to the website. In the final two weeks, I would send the app to the testers, review the feedback that is given and make the final changes so that the app is ready to be downloaded and used.</p>
