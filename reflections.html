<h2>Daniel </h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>I think that the group worked extremely well together, having been delegated jobs early on. I also think that discussions between the app group and the website group were a great way to obtain feedback from each other.</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>I think our scheduling of meetings and writing up the report could have been done a lot better. Like assignment 2, we scheduled meetings pretty last minute which meant that some group members could not attend the meetings live and had to watch the recordings.</p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One thing that was surprising to me was the things that could not get done within the time frame. As our project had time constraints, we had to decide which features to leave out. As I was working on developing the app, there were a lot of things that had to be left out and this surprised me.</p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>One thing I learnt about groups is how well every member can work if there is a team leader. I definitely could see the difference between working in a team without a delegated team leader and a group that has one. The difference is immense and I think that this factor played a crucial role in our success as a team.</p>
<h3>GitHub Log of Activity</h3>
<p>I think my GitHub activity reflects pretty well on how I contributed to the group. As I created the group repository, it would only mean that there was just a little more activity than my other group members.</p>

<h2>Simon</h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>What went well with our group is that everyone was organised with their parts, and we were all able to form into groups one for website and one for app. Everyone contributed well with their parts in their group which i am really proud of.</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>What could be improved is that some people were not able to attend our meetings and it should be something that we can work on, such as everyone making sure that they put our meetings into their calendar so that it prevents people from forgetting. </p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One that was surprising was the design of our app and website. The people that designed the app and website did really well and looks a lot like a real website. </p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>One thing I learnt about my group is to trust others with their parts and that they will get it done before the deadline. By having trust with the group, our assignment will go much smoother and end up most of the time receiving a good mark. </p>
<h3>Github Log of Activity</h3>
<p>Since we split up into different groups and I was part of the website group, I did not use Github at all, and I was also given the tasks to work on the google documents so most of my roles was to work on the writing bits of our project.

<h2>Cameron</h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>I believe splitting up the project into smaller, manageable tasks and groups really helped with completing the project to the best of our abilities. This allowed us to concentrate on our designated tasks without worrying too much about what the other group ios doing, knowing that they will produce a high quality result.
</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>Something that I could have improved would be to start writing what I was assigned early, and to increase the number of large group meetings. By increasing these meetings, both groups can understand how much progress has been done, and people can voice any concerns they may have.
</p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One thing that was surprising is creating the website. I have not used Adobe XD before, but after using it to develop the website aspect of the project, I found it surprisingly straightforward and easy to understand from an outside perspective. Along with using Adobe XD, the creative cloud Adobe offers allows collaboration, which helped us complete the website efficiently.
</p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>I learned that splitting the group up into smaller sub-groups really helps with not being confused as to what everyoneâ€™s job is. By working with a smaller number of people, we were able to communicate more efficiently and have a clearer understanding of our tasks in the smaller group.
</p>
<h3>Github Log of Activity</h3>
<p> I did not use GitHub until the very end of the assignment, where I uploaded my writing parts to the document. I mainly used GitHub when I had finished my writing aspects of the report, to update the corresponding parts on the website.
