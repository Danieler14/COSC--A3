        <h1> Group Reflections </h1>

<h2>Cassie </h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>I think what really went well this time in comparison to the last assignment was splitting up the group. Since its such a large group of 7 people it had made it extremely difficult to organise meetings where everyone could attend. Splitting the group up made it not only easier to organise smaller group meetings but also spread out the workload better so that 1 group could focus on the app development and the other could focus on the website development.
</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>I think we underestimated how difficult it would have been to get 4 people to work on the website at once, and we did end up changing it so that there were 2 main people actually designing the prototype, and then 2 others supporting with ideas and suggestions and working more on the document.
</p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One thing I found surprising was the level of detail needed in order to be able to create a functioning app and website login page. I went into this assignment thinking we may be able to use github with HTML and CSS to produce the PTV Rewards app, but I was extremely wrong. The UI and skills needed to create something like this is far more advanced than I would have expected.
</p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>One thing I have learned about groups is that when you pull back and don't micromanage as much, others will step up to the plate. I have learned that I need to trust my group members more and relax a bit. </p>
<h3>Github Log of Activity</h3>
<p>Most of our GitHub log activity was done towards the end. The way we have structured how this works is we make sure all components are done, reviewed and good to go and then it's uploaded. All parts uploaded should be either a part someone worked on or a part that they did. </p>

<h2>Daniel </h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>I think that the group worked extremely well together, having been delegated jobs early on. I also think that discussions between the app group and the website group were a great way to obtain feedback from each other.</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>I think our scheduling of meetings and writing up the report could have been done a lot better. Like assignment 2, we scheduled meetings pretty last minute which meant that some group members could not attend the meetings live and had to watch the recordings.</p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One thing that was surprising to me was the things that could not get done within the time frame. As our project had time constraints, we had to decide which features to leave out. As I was working on developing the app, there were a lot of things that had to be left out and this surprised me.</p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>One thing I learnt about groups is how well every member can work if there is a team leader. I definitely could see the difference between working in a team without a delegated team leader and a group that has one. The difference is immense and I think that this factor played a crucial role in our success as a team.</p>
<h3>GitHub Log of Activity</h3>
<p>I think my GitHub activity reflects pretty well on how I contributed to the group. As I created the group repository, it would only mean that there was just a little more activity than my other group members.</p>

<h2>Simon</h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>What went well with our group is that everyone was organised with their parts, and we were all able to form into groups one for website and one for app. Everyone contributed well with their parts in their group which i am really proud of.</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>What could be improved is that some people were not able to attend our meetings and it should be something that we can work on, such as everyone making sure that they put our meetings into their calendar so that it prevents people from forgetting. </p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One that was surprising was the design of our app and website. The people that designed the app and website did really well and looks a lot like a real website. </p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>One thing I learnt about my group is to trust others with their parts and that they will get it done before the deadline. By having trust with the group, our assignment will go much smoother and end up most of the time receiving a good mark. </p>
<h3>Github Log of Activity</h3>
<p>Since we split up into different groups and I was part of the website group, I did not use Github at all, and I was also given the tasks to work on the google documents so most of my roles was to work on the writing bits of our project.
