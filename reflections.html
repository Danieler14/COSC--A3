        <h1> Group Reflections </h1>

<h2>Cassie </h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>I think what really went well this time in comparison to the last assignment was splitting up the group. Since its such a large group of 7 people it had made it extremely difficult to organise meetings where everyone could attend. Splitting the group up made it not only easier to organise smaller group meetings but also spread out the workload better so that 1 group could focus on the app development and the other could focus on the website development.
</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>I think we underestimated how difficult it would have been to get 4 people to work on the website at once, and we did end up changing it so that there were 2 main people actually designing the prototype, and then 2 others supporting with ideas and suggestions and working more on the document.
</p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One thing I found surprising was the level of detail needed in order to be able to create a functioning app and website login page. I went into this assignment thinking we may be able to use github with HTML and CSS to produce the PTV Rewards app, but I was extremely wrong. The UI and skills needed to create something like this is far more advanced than I would have expected.
</p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>One thing I have learned about groups is that when you pull back and don't micromanage as much, others will step up to the plate. I have learned that I need to trust my group members more and relax a bit. </p>
<h3>Github Log of Activity</h3>
<p>Most of our GitHub log activity was done towards the end. The way we have structured how this works is we make sure all components are done, reviewed and good to go and then it's uploaded. All parts uploaded should be either a part someone worked on or a part that they did. </p>

<h2>Daniel </h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>I think that the group worked extremely well together, having been delegated jobs early on. I also think that discussions between the app group and the website group were a great way to obtain feedback from each other.</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>I think our scheduling of meetings and writing up the report could have been done a lot better. Like assignment 2, we scheduled meetings pretty last minute which meant that some group members could not attend the meetings live and had to watch the recordings.</p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One thing that was surprising to me was the things that could not get done within the time frame. As our project had time constraints, we had to decide which features to leave out. As I was working on developing the app, there were a lot of things that had to be left out and this surprised me.</p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>One thing I learnt about groups is how well every member can work if there is a team leader. I definitely could see the difference between working in a team without a delegated team leader and a group that has one. The difference is immense and I think that this factor played a crucial role in our success as a team.</p>
<h3>GitHub Log of Activity</h3>
<p>I think my GitHub activity reflects pretty well on how I contributed to the group. As I created the group repository, it would only mean that there was just a little more activity than my other group members.</p>

<h2>Simon</h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>What went well with our group is that everyone was organised with their parts, and we were all able to form into groups one for website and one for app. Everyone contributed well with their parts in their group which i am really proud of.</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>What could be improved is that some people were not able to attend our meetings and it should be something that we can work on, such as everyone making sure that they put our meetings into their calendar so that it prevents people from forgetting. </p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One that was surprising was the design of our app and website. The people that designed the app and website did really well and looks a lot like a real website. </p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>One thing I learnt about my group is to trust others with their parts and that they will get it done before the deadline. By having trust with the group, our assignment will go much smoother and end up most of the time receiving a good mark. </p>
<h3>Github Log of Activity</h3>
<p>Since we split up into different groups and I was part of the website group, I did not use Github at all, and I was also given the tasks to work on the google documents so most of my roles was to work on the writing bits of our project.

<h2>Cameron</h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>I believe splitting up the project into smaller, manageable tasks and groups really helped with completing the project to the best of our abilities. This allowed us to concentrate on our designated tasks without worrying too much about what the other group ios doing, knowing that they will produce a high quality result.
</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>Something that I could have improved would be to start writing what I was assigned early, and to increase the number of large group meetings. By increasing these meetings, both groups can understand how much progress has been done, and people can voice any concerns they may have.
</p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One thing that was surprising is creating the website. I have not used Adobe XD before, but after using it to develop the website aspect of the project, I found it surprisingly straightforward and easy to understand from an outside perspective. Along with using Adobe XD, the creative cloud Adobe offers allows collaboration, which helped us complete the website efficiently.
</p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>I learned that splitting the group up into smaller sub-groups really helps with not being confused as to what everyoneâ€™s job is. By working with a smaller number of people, we were able to communicate more efficiently and have a clearer understanding of our tasks in the smaller group.
</p>
<h3>Github Log of Activity</h3>
<p> I did not use GitHub until the very end of the assignment, where I uploaded my writing parts to the document. I mainly used GitHub when I had finished my writing aspects of the report, to update the corresponding parts on the website.

<h2>Andrew</h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>Organisation was a lot better when compared to our last assignment. Right from the start, everyone was quick to be vocal about what they wanted to take part in making it immensely easier to assign certain portions of the project.</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>An improvement that seems to be impossible to fix was trying to find adequate time for meetings to take place. It was hard to find a good time to have every member at every meeting but we managed to think of a partial solution which involved dividing the group into two (for the website and app) and having meetings in those assigned groups.</p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>A thing I found surprising was how extensive creating an app and website is. The amount of roles and work that is required for these developments is insane, considering a lot of it is done behind the scenes. It made me see both app and web developments through a new lens, having a new appreciation for even the more negligible aspects I used to look over.</p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>One thing I learned about group work would be that subdividing a big group into smaller groups can increase efficiency and communication tremendously. I found it more engaging to have small group discussions as everyone was given more time to talk and work out solutions to problems we encountered.</p>
<h3>Github Log of Activity</h3>
<p>Most of, if not all, our GitHub log of activity took place towards the end of the project. Proof-reading and adjustments were made using Google Docs and then sent to the GitHub repository. Overall, GitHub was a great way to incorporate every aspect of the project as everyone played a part in adding their part to the repository.</p>
