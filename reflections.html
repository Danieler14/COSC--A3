<h2>Daniel </h2>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>I think that the group worked extremely well together, having been delegated jobs early on. I also think that discussions between the app group and the website group were a great way to obtain feedback from each other.</p>
<h3>What could be improved</h3>
<p>I think our scheduling of meetings and writing up the report could have been done a lot better. Like assignment 2, we scheduled meetings pretty last minute which meant that some group members could not attend the meetings live and had to watch the recordings.</p>
<h3>One thing that was surprising</h3>
<p>One thing that was surprising to me was the things that could not get done within the time frame. As our project had time constraints, we had to decide which features to leave out. As I was working on developing the app, there were a lot of things that had to be left out and this surprised me.</p>
<h3>One thing I learnt about groups</h3>
<p>One thing I learnt about groups is how well every member can work if there is a team leader. I definitely could see the difference between working in a team without a delegated team leader and a group that has one. The difference is immense and I think that this factor played a crucial role in our success as a team.</p>
<h3>GitHub Log of Activity</h3>
<p>I think my GitHub activity reflects pretty well on how I contributed to the group. As I created the group repository, it would only mean that there was just a little more activity than my other group members.</p>
