<h4>The Progress</h4>
<p>In Week 9, I researched possible software and websites that are free to use to create an app. I went to Appypie, then to Apphive and finally to Proto.io. I found that Proto.io was the best out of the three because it was easy to use after playing around with it and that it had a 15-day free trial. In Week 10, I designed the first couple of screens and added colour. I knew that this wasn’t going to be the final design but I thought that I needed to at least have one design so that I could add the features in. I added colour and the relevant content to each screen. Furthermore, I added a navigation bar at the bottom so that it would be easier to change from screen to screen within the app. In Week 11, I updated the screens so that they correlate with the Mock-Up sketches provided by the team whilst also adding more content to the credit wallet, prize draw and QR code screens. In Week 12, the other app group members began to finalise the design, changing the colour, moving objects around so that they look nice and gave it a final touch. In Week 13, I added the UI into the app. These UI features of Proto.io included buttons, screen transitions, changing screen states and gave the app a settings bar. When tapping onto one of the icons on the navigation bar, I made the screen transition so that it slid left if the icon on the right hand-side of the icon of the current screen. For example, if I am on the home page right now (icon is the left-most icon on the navigation bar) and I wanted to go to the credit tab, once I tab on the credit tab icon, the screen would slide left and transition to the credit tab. However, although this was the plan, I forgot to make sure I added the transitions before the free trial ended so some of the screens will have the transitions and some won’t. I made the first screen of the app the login page because it is usually what apps have their start screen as. I also added notifications. Once clicking the login button on the login page, it would transition to the home page with a notification stating that the user needs to give location access to the app. The same would happen if the user clicked onto the QR Code icon on the navigation bar. Eventually, I finished the UI aspect of the app and finalised everything. When sharing a Proto.io project, you are able to share it and preview it using a link. After the free trial expired, I was unable to access a preview, get another link nor edit the app itself. But thankfully, my other team members had downloaded a preview of the app which I didn’t know about.</p>
<h4>Dead Ends</h4>
<p>A main part of creating an app was to code it. As we had a time-restriction of a couple of weeks to create a project, it was not feasible to learn to code and implement it into the app. 
  Another dilemma I had to face was to create the app for both IOS and Android. Again due to time constraints, I had to pick between the two. I ended up choosing IOS because I am familiar with it the most. Some of the features that we couldn’t include within the app are the filters feature on the home page, linking the app to the phone’s camera and using the user’s location. I was unable to add the filter feature because it would take too long to build as I would have to move every coupon around so that it matches the filter. If we multiply that by the amount of filters we would have, it would be a lot of work and not enough time to do so. I was unable to link the phone’s camera and location to the app because there is no feature on Proto.io that allows me to do so.</p>
