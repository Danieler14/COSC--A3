  <h2>Cassie</h2>
  <p>I was originally born in Australia, but moved to Hawaii when I was five and lived there for 12 years. After highschool I moved back over to Australia and mostly worked full time in hospitality. Currently I now work in tech support, and in my free time I like to play video games, and spend time researching cool tech. My IT experience mainly revolves around the basic troubleshooting that I have learned while on the job, and apart from that I have not had much former IT experience. I became interested in IT after I began to play video games,  and my passion for IT has since grown working in the IT Industry.</p>

  <h2>Andrew</h2> <img src="andrew.JPG" alt height="280px;" style="float:right;/* text-align; right;*/">
  <p>My name is Andrew and I was born here in Australia, but come from a mixed background – my father is Romanian and my mother is Filipino. I completed my schooling at Woorana Park Primary School, Waverley Christian College and studied at Monash Uni for a bit. I currently work as a tradie part-time doing rigging (steel construction). I first gained an interest in IT at a very young age when I used to play games on my PSP. Since then I’ve been fascinated with having powerful devices that can be used anywhere, resulting in my interest in developing and maintaining both apps and websites suitable for the everyday user. Some hobbies of mine include soccer, snowboarding, skateboarding and camping</p>

  <h2>Afiq</h2> <img src="afiq.png" alt height="280px;" style="float:right;/* text-align; right;*/">
  <p>I was born in Malaysia and have been living there my whole life up until now, pursuing my studies here in Melbourne, Australia. Sport is mainly a part of who I am as a person. I am always intrigued to associate myself with sport activities especially in soccer since I was 8, up until now. My interest in IT sparked when I was in high school where I was taught programming language. The knowledge of it made me understand better at how things operate behind the scenes, in the technology industry. Therefore, it encourages me to learn more of its language as it is the future in almost every industry there is.</p>
