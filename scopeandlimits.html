        <h1> Scope and Limits </h1>
        <p>All projects have their limits as a result of deadlines. In our project in particular, we understand that there will be some aspects of PTV Rewards that will not be completed. One of these features include the actual coding of the app, which is the basis of developing an app. As learning a programming language can take very long to master, it means that we are not able to implement some sort of code into our app. However, even though we cannot implement code, it does not mean that we cannot develop screens that show on the app. Using proto.io, we are able to design how the app would look and how screens would transition without needing any code. Another limit would be that there would be some features within the app that cannot be developed. For example, due to the time constraint, we are unable to develop the ‘filter’ feature on the home page that filters coupons based on the number of credits required, location, preferences etc. Furthermore, as we have a maps feature, which uses the geographical location of the user, and a QR code tab, which utilises the phone’s camera, these will not work in the prototype. The best we are able to achieve is in the maps feature is to upload a photo of a location on Google Maps and put it into the app. For the QR code tab, we were able to implement a notification that tells the user to allow camera access for the app and give an example of the screen of successfully scanning a QR code. Moreover, another limit could be that we cannot develop a login system. As our app requires users to create an account and sign-in, it would need the use of a system that stores the data of created accounts. Due to time, we cannot utilise this. On the other hand, the outcomes that we are able to show are the screens and their transitions within the app. We are also able to show the website that allows businesses to login and add their coupons and view their statistics. </p>
