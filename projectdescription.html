<h4>PTV Rewards App</h4>

<h5>The Progress</h5>
<p>In Week 9, I researched possible software and websites that are free to use to create an app. I went to Appypie, then to Apphive and finally to Proto.io. I found that Proto.io was the best out of the three because it was easy to use after playing around with it and that it had a 15-day free trial. In Week 10, I designed the first couple of screens and added colour. I knew that this wasn’t going to be the final design but I thought that I needed to at least have one design so that I could add the features in. I added colour and the relevant content to each screen. Furthermore, I added a navigation bar at the bottom so that it would be easier to change from screen to screen within the app. In Week 11, I updated the screens so that they correlate with the Mock-Up sketches provided by the team whilst also adding more content to the credit wallet, prize draw and QR code screens. In Week 12, the other app group members began to finalise the design, changing the colour, moving objects around so that they look nice and gave it a final touch. In Week 13, I added the UI into the app. These UI features of Proto.io included buttons, screen transitions, changing screen states and gave the app a settings bar. When tapping onto one of the icons on the navigation bar, I made the screen transition so that it slid left if the icon on the right hand-side of the icon of the current screen. For example, if I am on the home page right now (icon is the left-most icon on the navigation bar) and I wanted to go to the credit tab, once I tab on the credit tab icon, the screen would slide left and transition to the credit tab. However, although this was the plan, I forgot to make sure I added the transitions before the free trial ended so some of the screens will have the transitions and some won’t. I made the first screen of the app the login page because it is usually what apps have their start screen as. I also added notifications. Once clicking the login button on the login page, it would transition to the home page with a notification stating that the user needs to give location access to the app. The same would happen if the user clicked onto the QR Code icon on the navigation bar. Eventually, I finished the UI aspect of the app and finalised everything. When sharing a Proto.io project, you are able to share it and preview it using a link. After the free trial expired, I was unable to access a preview, get another link nor edit the app itself. But thankfully, my other team members had downloaded a preview of the app which I didn’t know about.</p>

<h5>Dead Ends</h5>
<p>A main part of creating an app was to code it. As we had a time-restriction of a couple of weeks to create a project, it was not feasible to learn to code and implement it into the app. 
  Another dilemma I had to face was to create the app for both IOS and Android. Again due to time constraints, I had to pick between the two. I ended up choosing IOS because I am familiar with it the most. Some of the features that we couldn’t include within the app are the filters feature on the home page, linking the app to the phone’s camera and using the user’s location. I was unable to add the filter feature because it would take too long to build as I would have to move every coupon around so that it matches the filter. If we multiply that by the amount of filters we would have, it would be a lot of work and not enough time to do so. I was unable to link the phone’s camera and location to the app because there is no feature on Proto.io that allows me to do so.</p>

<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
<p>All projects have their limits as a result of deadlines. In our project in particular, we understand that there will be some aspects of PTV Rewards that will not be completed. One of these features include the actual coding of the app, which is the basis of developing an app. As learning a programming language can take very long to master, it means that we are not able to implement some sort of code into our app. However, even though we cannot implement code, it does not mean that we cannot develop screens that show on the app. Using proto.io, we are able to design how the app would look and how screens would transition without needing any code. Another limit would be that there would be some features within the app that cannot be developed. For example, due to the time constraint, we are unable to develop the ‘filter’ feature on the home page that filters coupons based on the number of credits required, location, preferences etc. Furthermore, as we have a maps feature, which uses the geographical location of the user, and a QR code tab, which utilises the phone’s camera, these will not work in the prototype. The best we are able to achieve is in the maps feature is to upload a photo of a location on Google Maps and put it into the app. For the QR code tab, we were able to implement a notification that tells the user to allow camera access for the app and give an example of the screen of successfully scanning a QR code. Moreover, another limit could be that we cannot develop a login system. As our app requires users to create an account and sign-in, it would need the use of a system that stores the data of created accounts. Due to time, we cannot utilise this. On the other hand, the outcomes that we are able to show are the screens and their transitions within the app. We are also able to show the website that allows businesses to login and add their coupons and view their statistics. </p>
