<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>This project “PTV Rewards System” is a system that tracks users when they touch on and off when using trams, trains or buses. When touching on and off, it will add a point to the user’s selected account that they would have needed to create on the PTV app. By using this system, it will encourage people to use public transport the right way, hoping to minimise the total amount of myki fines that are given out in a year. Moreover, with these enticing rewards, people are more likely to rely less on cars and use public transport making the environment a much more sustainable place. </p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>PTV rewards is an important project as it will have a positive impact in our community. People will rely less on cars to get to locations, which will improve fuel efficiency and reduce air pollution, economically benefiting the society. Moreover, with the increased complaints of users that have been fined due to not using their mykis over the past few years, hopefully with this reward system, it will reduce the amount of users being caught and fined hundreds of dollars as they will feel more inclined to touch on and off as they feel rewarded for doing the right thing. With the reliance of phones being used for pretty much everything, the usage of applications on phone devices is definitely still a current IT trend. With this being said, PTV rewards will fit perfectly with this current trend as it would be designed on an app, being linked to the actual PTV app. As our main purpose of this project is very eco-friendly and sustainable, it would show future employers that our methods and processes would be benevolent if we were to implement this idea into the real world, inviting them to work on this project. </p>

<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>Some similar systems or projects that are available right now would be uber rewards. This company uses a similar reward system to our project in terms of accumulating points when utilising their service. However, what makes PTV rewards different from other competitors such as Uber rewards is that it entices people to do the right thing, which is to touch on and off when using public transportation. As of right now, there is really no reward system in terms of transport that focuses on creating a greater community hence, another key difference is that our project has a main focus to contribute in making the society a better place, by reducing the amount of fines that are given out to civilians that do not touch on or off and even influence the community to use public transport more often. </p>

<h2>Detailed Descriptions</h2>
<h3>Aims</h3>
<p>Our project “PTV rewards” is a system that aims to give back to the community by rewarding those that do the right thing when using public transport, which is to touch on and off. With many complaints on myki fares being too expensive, (averaging around $4.50 for adult fare per trip), it causes many people to not do the right thing and free load when using public transports. Moreover, this would lead to an increased number of fines given out to people which will get people more angry and create a negative impact on the community. Hence, with this rewards system in place, it will be a perfect incentive for people to do the right thing as some will now have a purpose to use their mykis correctly, resulting in less complaints on myki fares and fines given out. 

One goal that would be helpful for achieving our aim is supporting small businesses. By partnering up with small businesses and having them give access to us to give discounts to our consumers, they would be advertised by PTV which is a big company and most definitely attracts a large market, resulting in increased sales and bigger profits. Supporting small businesses is a main factor when it comes to implementing our project, as it is the main incentive for people to touch on and off. As a result, achieving this small goal is crucial as by providing more discounts from many different small businesses, it will lead to happy customers doing the right thing, achieving our main goal. 

Another goal would be to create a more eco-friendly liveable society. With this ptv reward system being introduced, it would increase the number of users using public transport and potentially reduce the reliance of using cars to get to certain places. Thus, with an increased demand in using public transport, it will result in a reduction of carbon emissions, air pollution and most importantly, fatal car crashes as there will be a QR code at festivals, or big events which will give access to the “PTV rewards system” app logging into their account and validating if they used public transport to get to the event/festival. With this being used, it will attract more users to use public transport as they feel a sense of reward when using public transport to get to the festivals and as a result less cars will be used overtime.

<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>

<h5>The Progress</h5>
<p>In Week 9, I researched possible software and websites that are free to use to create an app. I went to Appypie, then to Apphive and finally to Proto.io. I found that Proto.io was the best out of the three because it was easy to use after playing around with it and that it had a 15-day free trial. In Week 10, I designed the first couple of screens and added colour. I knew that this wasn’t going to be the final design but I thought that I needed to at least have one design so that I could add the features in. I added colour and the relevant content to each screen. Furthermore, I added a navigation bar at the bottom so that it would be easier to change from screen to screen within the app. In Week 11, I updated the screens so that they correlate with the Mock-Up sketches provided by the team whilst also adding more content to the credit wallet, prize draw and QR code screens. In Week 12, the other app group members began to finalise the design, changing the colour, moving objects around so that they look nice and gave it a final touch. In Week 13, I added the UI into the app. These UI features of Proto.io included buttons, screen transitions, changing screen states and gave the app a settings bar. When tapping onto one of the icons on the navigation bar, I made the screen transition so that it slid left if the icon on the right hand-side of the icon of the current screen. For example, if I am on the home page right now (icon is the left-most icon on the navigation bar) and I wanted to go to the credit tab, once I tab on the credit tab icon, the screen would slide left and transition to the credit tab. However, although this was the plan, I forgot to make sure I added the transitions before the free trial ended so some of the screens will have the transitions and some won’t. I made the first screen of the app the login page because it is usually what apps have their start screen as. I also added notifications. Once clicking the login button on the login page, it would transition to the home page with a notification stating that the user needs to give location access to the app. The same would happen if the user clicked onto the QR Code icon on the navigation bar. Eventually, I finished the UI aspect of the app and finalised everything. When sharing a Proto.io project, you are able to share it and preview it using a link. After the free trial expired, I was unable to access a preview, get another link nor edit the app itself. But thankfully, my other team members had downloaded a preview of the app which I didn’t know about.</p>

<h5>Dead Ends</h5>
<p>A main part of creating an app was to code it. As we had a time-restriction of a couple of weeks to create a project, it was not feasible to learn to code and implement it into the app. 
  Another dilemma I had to face was to create the app for both IOS and Android. Again due to time constraints, I had to pick between the two. I ended up choosing IOS because I am familiar with it the most. Some of the features that we couldn’t include within the app are the filters feature on the home page, linking the app to the phone’s camera and using the user’s location. I was unable to add the filter feature because it would take too long to build as I would have to move every coupon around so that it matches the filter. If we multiply that by the amount of filters we would have, it would be a lot of work and not enough time to do so. I was unable to link the phone’s camera and location to the app because there is no feature on Proto.io that allows me to do so.</p>

<h5>The Story</h5>
<p>
Initially, it all started with a different project which was about security safety however the whole group came to a decision to work on this project as it is more suitable and creates a bigger positive impact to the society. After we decided that we were going to work on this “PTV reward system” project, we needed to figure out the main aim and smaller goals that can help achieve this idea.Next we scoped an overview to create an app and a website in order to advertise and promote our project to the public. From then on, we branched off into two groups, one group of 3, working on the app, and the other group of 4 working on the website.

Where we are up to: App
The group of 3 has finished and are polishing the app. The login page will be shown first when the user enters the app, which from then on they are asked to enter their details and most importantly their myki card number which is located at the back of the user’s myki. From then on, they will be given access to the rewards and the amount of points that are needed to receive discounts from certain businesses. 

Where we are up to: Website
Our whole group has finished the important components that are required for our project. We included a login page, which then requires you to input an abn number and a password. From there, the customer will be given options that they can choose from, managing coupons, the locations of the businesses that offer the discounts and the insights which are the statistics of the amount of coupons that are used for each business.

<h3>Roles</h3>
<p></p>


<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
<p>All projects have their limits as a result of deadlines. In our project in particular, we understand that there will be some aspects of PTV Rewards that will not be completed. One of these features include the actual coding of the app, which is the basis of developing an app. As learning a programming language can take very long to master, it means that we are not able to implement some sort of code into our app. However, even though we cannot implement code, it does not mean that we cannot develop screens that show on the app. Using proto.io, we are able to design how the app would look and how screens would transition without needing any code. Another limit would be that there would be some features within the app that cannot be developed. For example, due to the time constraint, we are unable to develop the ‘filter’ feature on the home page that filters coupons based on the number of credits required, location, preferences etc. Furthermore, as we have a maps feature, which uses the geographical location of the user, and a QR code tab, which utilises the phone’s camera, these will not work in the prototype. The best we are able to achieve is in the maps feature is to upload a photo of a location on Google Maps and put it into the app. For the QR code tab, we were able to implement a notification that tells the user to allow camera access for the app and give an example of the screen of successfully scanning a QR code. Moreover, another limit could be that we cannot develop a login system. As our app requires users to create an account and sign-in, it would need the use of a system that stores the data of created accounts. Due to time, we cannot utilise this. On the other hand, the outcomes that we are able to show are the screens and their transitions within the app. We are also able to show the website that allows businesses to login and add their coupons and view their statistics. </p>
