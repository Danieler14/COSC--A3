<h1> Skills and Jobs </h1>
<h3></h3>Having good character within a team not only amplifies teamwork and how good they can work together; but it could also show the venture capitalists, a sign of trust for them to consistently support throughout the project we have established. Therefore, listing a masterclass of a job description would be essential to recruit employees for our designated team. Primarily, identifying the potential candidates for the expected piece of work to be delivered is necessary to manifest them with a clearer path to what our goals are towards the future. This would neglect them to have second thoughts on the given role’s element in a team. Upcoming team members need to acknowledge our aim of introducing a point system on the myki card to ensure the community uses public transport more to receive luring rewards and have a sustainable environment within the community. With the project consisting of majority technology work, it is ideal to have associates with experience in IT work. Having database engineers is essentially important as to keep track of future users’ background information which can be gathered safely. In addition, other than focusing on the public, they could also assist in developing the update system required for business owners to be able to customise their coupons and designated locations according to their liking. Moreover, each member in the desired team must follow the rules and regulations that have been set by the project team manager. This is a high quality customer service and administrative support role that provides the first source of advice and guidance in relation to Mykid Rewards policy, procedures and processes. Every member is required to exercise judgement, set priorities and schedule work to meet deadlines.

Furthermore, as the project manager has been appointed, there are still a few important roles remaining to be assigned. It is common in a project team for members to seek assistance within each other, so it is key to have individuals who can provide aid for others in need at ease. Therefore, employing individuals who are naturally willing to have those types of characteristics magnifies the team’s morale by engaging others in a positive environment within the workspace. This would automatically impact everyone’s mentality to not be afraid of making mistakes, which is relatively a good step for members to initiate ideas of their own without being judged by others. Along with discussing within a group, it is essential to have members to work in the technology department, which is a fairly big part of our project. Having individuals with experience in Information Technology would be a huge boost in making our project a lot easier. Admittedly, having members with a sense of leadership would be the icing on the cake to ultimately have a sense of responsibility and enabling smooth communication with roles that have been delegated towards each other. This would also avoid any misconduct and any form of arrogance which could disrupt any teamwork that has been held during the project.
